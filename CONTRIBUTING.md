## All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Make sure the syle of your code is consistent with that of the current one (indentation, etc.).
4. If you've changed any relevant functionalities, update the README.md.
5. Ensure the application is working correctly. The `shinytest::testApp()` function should pass without unexpected issues (see _Testing_ under [README.md](https://github.com/gasparl/esdi/blob/master/README.md "README").
6. Issue that pull request.
